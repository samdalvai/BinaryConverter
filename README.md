# Binary converter
This application performs the conversion of decimal numbers into binary form and vice versa. Numbers can be converted into other forms, for example Octal and Hexadecimal representation. Moreover, floating point conversion is also possible. Although Java libraries that compute such conversions already exists, this small project explores the application of the scientific methods and algorithms studied during the computer science course in **Computer Systems Architecture** and their translation as code.
